Documentation

The full documentation can be found in the doc subdirectory.  There
are an extensive manual and a very short guide for impatient users in
Postscript and Pdf formats.

Quickstart
----------

  git clone https://github.com/coti/SKaMPI.git
  cd skampi
  ./configure
  make
  mpirun -np 2 ./skampi -i ski/skampi_pt2pt.ski

Main configuration flags:
--disable-mpi      : by default, MPI is enabled. This will disable
                     the compilation of the MPI support, measurements
		     and infrastructure. OpenSHMEM must be enabled.
--enable-openshmem : enable OpenSHMEM. This will compile the OpenSHMEM
                     measurement functions and, if MPI is disabled,
		     the OpenSHMEM infrastructure.
--prefix           : installation path.
